              <p>This project was carried out by myself and my teammate, Khanh Tran (Eddie), as part of the CIS 5710 course during Spring 2025 at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

              <p>In this project, we developed a custom 32-bit RISC-V core using SystemVerilog. The technical specifications of our design are as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> 32-bit RISC-V core implemented in SystemVerilog</li>
                <li><strong>Pipeline:</strong> Five-stage fully pipelined datapath featuring:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Full bypassing (forwarding) logic</li>
                    <li>Comprehensive stall control to handle data and control hazards</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cache:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Direct-mapped data cache (D$)</li>
                    <li>Direct-mapped instruction cache (I$) (currently under development)</li>
                    <li>Communication with main memory via the AXI4-Lite protocol</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Carry-Lookahead Adder (CLA) for low-latency arithmetic operations</li>
                    <li>8-cycle divider to reduce critical path delays and improve maximum clock frequency</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>Our implementation is functionally correct, as verified by the Dhrystone benchmark. The design was synthesized using the Yosys toolchain and deployed on a Lattice ECP5 FPGA board.</p>

              <p>Performance metrics and resource utilization of our design are reported in the table below:</p>

              <div class="table-responsive" style="width: fit-content; margin: 0 auto;">
                <table class="table table-bordered text-center">
                  <thead class="table-light">
                    <tr>
                      <th>Metric</th>
                      <th>Without caches</th>
                      <th>With caches</th>
                    </tr>
                  </thead>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Max frequency</td><td>30.78 MHz</td><td>26.64 MHz</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>LUT</td><td>30.9%</td><td>22.8%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Flip-Flop</td><td>4.1%</td><td>3.9%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Multiplier Blocks</td><td>3.2%</td><td>2.6%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>BRAM</td><td>1.0%</td><td>15.4%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>I/O Blocks</td><td>4.4%</td><td>4.4%</td></tr>
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>

              <p class="mt-2"><strong>Note:</strong> Since the <em>with-caches</em> version was later developed, several logic optimizations were made by us. As a result, its LUT and flip-flop usage is slightly more efficient compared to its predecessor.</p>
