                A big shoutout to my incredible teammates — Prakriti Prasad, Shreyas Muthusamy and Shubhodeep Aditya — who stood by me through an unforgettable semester. From countless sleepless nights of debugging to all the shared moments of frustration and small wins, I’ve learned so much from each of you.
              </p>
              <p>This is a compilation of the methods that we have developed for our F1/10 cars for the labs and races in the course <strong>ESE 6150 - Autonomous Racing Cars</strong> @ University of Pennsylvania.</p>

                <h3>1. Reactive Methods</h3>
                <p>Reactive methods are control strategies that utilize real-time sensor data to generate immediate responses without relying on complex planning or mapping, making them effective when the agent lacks prior knowledge about surrounding environment. However, these approaches are quite sensitive to noise and uncertainty, have limited adaptability to complex scenarios, and often yield suboptimal behaviors.</p>

                <h5>Wall-following</h5>
                <p>The very first algorithm we employed was PID wall-following. Its principle is straightforward: the robot navigates along the wall while maintaining a fixed distance. The PID controller adjusts the steering angle to keep the distance between the agent and the wall constant.</p>
                <div class="text-center">
                  <img src="../../assets/projects/f1tenth/wall-follow-levined-blocked.gif" alt="PID wall-following" width="400">
                  <p class="fst-italic">PID wall-following</p>
                </div>
                <p>This algorithm has a relatively simple implementation; however, it demands extensive time for tuning the PID gains. Moreover, it is inefficient in handling environmental irregularities—for example, it struggles with sharp turns and indentations. Finally, achieving high velocities is almost impossible, as evidenced by significant wobbling even at a low speed, which would be exacerbated at higher speeds.</p>

                <h5>Gap-following</h5>
                <p>By identifying the nearest obstacles or sharp disparities in the LIDAR data and masking out an area corresponding to the agent’s size, gap-following algorithm defines gaps (open spaces) for navigation. The agent then moves toward the gap that is widest or extends the farthest.</p>
                <div class="row text-center">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="../../assets/projects/f1tenth/gap-follow-levine-blocked.gif" alt="Gap-following no obstacle" class="img-fluid">
                    <p class="fst-italic">Gap-following in obstacle-free map</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="../../assets/projects/f1tenth/gap-follow-levine-obs.gif" alt="Gap-following with obstacle" class="img-fluid">
                    <p class="fst-italic">Gap-following in obstacle map</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Apparently, this algorithm allows for much smoother motion and higher speeds than wall-following. Additionally, thanks to its smooth and stable motion, the robot can easily avoid obstacles while exploring an unknown environment (at a conservative speed). However, it still exhibits the inherent limitation of reactive methods, namely that the generated trajectories are suboptimal.</p>

              <section id="planning">
                <h3>2. Planning-based Methods</h3>
                <p>Reactive strategies are effective in well-structured and predictable environments but often struggle with local minima and unexpected oscillatory behavior. However, in racing, where even a few milliseconds can create huge difference, an optimal and efficient navigation is strictly required. Planning-based methods bring us closer to this objective by leveraging available environmental information (e.g., maps, constraints) or prior experience (e.g., recorded paths), resulting in more stable and optimal performance.</p>

                <h5>Pure Pursuit</h5>
                <p>Given a pre-planned trajectory and the agent’s ability to accurately locate itself in the environment (e.g., via SLAM and particle filter), pure pursuit algorithm computes driving commands by targeting a point at a fixed look-ahead distance along the planned path.</p>
                <div class="row text-center">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="../../assets/projects/f1tenth/pure-pursuit-slam-levine.gif" alt="Pure pursuit SLAM" class="img-fluid">

                  </div>
                  <div class="col-md-6">

                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Despite its suprising simplicity, this algorithm delivers superior speed and stability compared to reactive approaches. Additionally, developers can easily combine it with other methods to optimize the input trajectory or speed management, further improving lap times.</p>
